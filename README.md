Password Generator Program Documentation

In today’s world, creating a strong password is more important than ever. A strong password helps keep your online accounts safe and secure. The Password Generator program helps you create random passwords that are both strong and customized based on what you need. You can choose how long you want your password to be and what kinds of characters you want it to include, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Purpose of the Program
The main purpose of this program is to allow users to easily generate strong passwords. The user can choose the length of the password and the types of characters it should contain. By giving the user control over these choices, the program helps make sure that the generated password is unique, hard to guess, and secure.

Features
Customizable Length: You can choose the length of the password. The longer the password, the more secure it is.
Character Type Choices: You can pick the types of characters you want to use in the password, including:
Lowercase letters: a-z
Uppercase letters: A-Z
Digits: 0-9
Special characters: e.g., !@#$%^&*()
Random Generation: Once you've selected your options, the program randomly picks characters from the available types to create a secure password.
Password Validation: The program makes sure you don’t generate an empty password. If you don't choose any character types, it will remind you to make a selection.
How the Program Works
When you run the program, it asks for a few pieces of information:

Password Length: The program asks how long you want the password to be.
Character Type Selection: The program asks if you want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. You can type "y" (yes) or "n" (no) to select each option.
Based on your answers, the program then builds a pool of characters to choose from. For example, if you choose lowercase letters and numbers, the pool will include both a-z and 0-9. The program will then randomly pick characters from that pool until it reaches the desired password length.

Error Handling
The program checks if you’ve chosen at least one character type. If you don’t choose any, it will tell you that you must select at least one type before it can generate a password. This ensures that you don't end up with an empty or useless password.

Conclusion
This program is a useful tool for creating strong, random passwords that are tailored to your needs. It gives you control over how long your password is and what kinds of characters are included, making it easier to create secure passwords for online accounts. By using this program, you can ensure that your passwords are strong and harder to guess, which is an important part of keeping your online information safe.

In a world where hackers are always looking for weak passwords to exploit, using strong, unique passwords for every account is essential. The Password Generator program helps you do just that, making it easier to stay secure online.
